CSE 312 is both of our favorite classes this quarter!
We really enjoy all the TA's and Alex as they reply quickly to questions and always know how to explain things.
We really hope that we do well in this class and in this project because this class has without a doubt been very tough with everything going on.
Despite it all, we are very happy to almost be done and want to thank everyone for a great quarter.
Thanks for taking the time out of your summers to TA/Teach this class!
Right now I am just trying to write as much as I can so sorry if none of this make sense.  We just needed another file that had more than ten words.
Should I keep writing more? Or is this enough? I think this will have to do.
Thanks for taking time to read all of this.  Actually, who am I kidding, you definitely did not read any of this.  That's okay with us.
Stay safe. Stay healthy.
Go Dawgs!
