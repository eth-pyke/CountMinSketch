# CountMinSketch

Count-Min Sketch is a Python Data Structure used to determine the frequency of items within large sets of data.  Also included in this is a Python implementation of a Hash Table so that the two data structures can be compared.
# Description

driver.py: Main file to collect data on the comparison between the Count-Min Sketch and the Hash Table.\n
requirements.txt: File containing required python imports.\n
TestCMS.py: Test file for CMS.\n
TestHashTable.py: Test file for HT.\n
./text: Folder containing test files we test on.\n
./classes: Folder containing CountMinSketch and HashTable implementations.

# Usage

The file driver.py contains comparison results between the Count-Min Sketch and the Hash Table and can be ran by doing:

```bash
python driver.py
```
driver.py will create several graphs comparing the speed, accuracy, and memory usage between the CMS and Hash Table.

All data that is tested are contained within the /text folder.
